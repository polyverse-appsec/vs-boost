Boost is a powerful VS Code \"notebook\" extension designed to help you automatically convert your legacy code into a new programming language using AI.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n1.  **Load a legacy source file** using the `Boost: Load File` command. This will parse the file into distinct functions and place them into a `boost-notebook` file. Each function becomes a cell.\n\n2.  **Select the output language** for the conversion with the `Boost: Select Output Language` command.\n\n3.  **Perform the boost analysis** by clicking the \"run\" triangular button on the top left of each cell. The analysis may take up to a minute for the AI to process the code.\n\n4.  **Review the generated results**. After the analysis is complete, a new cell containing an English description of the code and the converted code in your selected language (e.g. Python) will be generated.\n\nMain Features\n-------------\n\n-   Automatically converts legacy code into a new programming language using AI.\n-   Provides an English description of the code to help understand its functionality.\n-   Each function is placed in a separate cell, allowing for easy organization and navigation.\n-   Select from a variety of output languages for code conversion.\n-   Save time and effort by automating the code conversion process.\n\nCommands\n--------\n\n-   `Boost: Load File`: Load a legacy source file to be converted.\n-   `Boost: Select Output Language`: Choose the output language for the code conversion.\n\nExtension Settings\n------------------\n\nPolyverse Boost extension settings can be configured in the VS Code settings. Available settings include:\n\n-   `polyverse.boost.defaultOutputLanguage`: Set the default output language for code conversion.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions about the Polyverse Boost extension, please refer to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/polyverse/boost-extension) or [documentation](https://docs.polyverse.io/boost-extension) for more information and support.\n\nHappy coding!"
