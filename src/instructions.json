   "markdown" : "# Boost: Visual Studio Code Extension by Polyverse\n=======================================\n\n**Empower your coding journey with AI-driven insights - Introducing Polyverse Boost!**\n\nWelcome aboard! Boost isn’t just another Visual Studio Code extension. It's your coding companion, designed to supercharge your workflow, ensure code security, and offer transformative insights. Dive into the future with Boost and unlock a world of AI-enhanced coding!\n\n## Dive Right In 🚀\n\n### Before We Start\n- 📌 **Have a [GitHub.com](https://GitHub.com) account handy**: We use this to seamlessly connect Boost to your coding world. And hey, privacy's our game — we won't share your email or use it for those pesky marketing emails. Just authentic, uninterrupted Boost experience.\n  \n- 📌 **Git for Authentication**: Make sure you have Git installed. Visual Studio Code and Boost love it. Grab it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.\n\n- 📌 **Trial and Billing**: Boost offers a sample to everyone with its free trial license. Account creation and $100 credit is automatic. To enable future Boosting with larger and more projects, just update your payment details in your Polyverse Boost account.\n\n### Set Up Boost\n\n1. **Welcome Boost**: Visit the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Polyverse.polyverse-boost) and get the Polyverse Boost extension. Here's a hint: look for the 'Install' button!\n   \n   ![Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://polyverse.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2023-07-28_at_3.09.01_PM.jpg?v=1690582157&width=500)\n\n2. **Hop Onboard**: Once you click 'Install', VS Code might want to check with you before opening up..\n\n   ![Permission to Install](https://polyverse.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2023-07-28_at_2.54.00_PM.jpg?v=1690581321&width=500)\n   \n   Some installations might require pressing the \"Install\" button in VS Code.

This saves you and Boost from having to manage passwords directly! Remember to press 'Allow'.\n\n   ![Approval Prompt](https://polyverse.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2023-07-28_at_3.03.13_PM.jpg?v=1690581814&width=500)\n\n   And remember, while we need your GitHub token for the magic to work, we’re not here to store your data. Promise!\n\n5. **Boost In Action**: To launch analysis on your project, use the Boost Activity Bar on the left to \"Run Selected Analyses\"\n\n   ![Run Selected Analyses](https://polyverse.com/cdn/shop/files/Screenshot_2023-07-28_at_2.59.14_PM.jpg?v=1690581580&width=500)\n\n   By default, you can run a sample of the top 5 AI-chosen files on any project, including security, data compliance, documentation and bug analysis.\n\n   You can also select \"Analyze All Files\" to analyze all files in your project.\n\n   The Sara AI will estimate your usage, costs and update on your current account status.\n\nFrom analyzing code for potential pitfalls, to transforming your old code to a fresh new modern code — Boost is packed with features. Explore, experiment, and elevate your coding game!\n\nGot questions or hit a snag?
