   "markdown" : "# Polyverse Boost Visual Studio Extension\n=======================================\n\n**Transform, secure, and enhance your code with AI-driven analysis, all in one powerful extension - *Polyverse Boost*.**\n\nWelcome to the Polyverse Boost Visual Studio extension! Boost is a powerful Visual Studio Code Notebook extension designed to help you automatically convert your legacy code into a new programming language, analyze code for security vulnerabilities, find data compliance issues, ensure your source follows best practice coding guidelines, and generate test cases for code using AI-driven tools. In minutes you can take your legacy C, C++, C#, Java, .NET or PHP code (and many others) and convert it to over a dozen modern languages.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Prequisites\n1. **Setup your Boost License** by contacting [Polyverse](https://polyverse.com/pages/boost-visual-studio) to get a free trial license key, or purchase a license key directly from the [Polyverse Store](https://polyverse.com/pages/boost-buy-visual-studio).\n\n2. **Setup a [GitHub.com[(https://GitHub.com) account** - to link your Polyverse license to your email address.\n\n### Installation\n1. **Install the Boost Modernization extension** from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Polyverse.polyverse-boost). NOTE: A restart of Visual Studio Code may be required.\n\n2. **Authorize and Link Your GitHub.com account with Boost** The first time you launch Boost, you may need to Allow and Authorize Boost to access GitHub.com. This is only required to link your license to your email address. If you have not already done so, you will need to create a GitHub.com account.\n\n   ![GitHub.com account access authorization](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-28_at_10.03.32_PM.jpg?width=500)\n\n3. **Create your first Boost Notebook** - using the Command dropdown and selecting `Create Polyverse Boost Notebook` (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) \n\n   ![Create Boost Notebook](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-26_at_5.40.18_PM.jpg?width=500)\n\n4. **Load your Source Code**: Use the `Boost: Load File` command to parse your source code into Boost Notebook cells so you can review and edit.\n\n5. **Select Your Modernization Process**: Use the `Boost: Select Kernel` command to choose from available AI-enhanced processing:\n\n   ![Select Your Processing Task](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-26_at_5.52.28_PM.jpg?width=500)\n  \n  * **Analyze Code for Bugs, Defects and Security Vulnerabilities** select `Analyze code for security vulnerabilities`\n  * **Modernize Code to a newer language** select `Convert Legacy Code to New Code`\n  * **Generate Test Cases** select `Generate Test Cases for code`\n  * **Generation Code Documentation** select `Explain code`\n\n   ![Available Processing Tasks](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-28_at_10.26.59_PM.jpg?width=500)\n\n\n6. _NOTE: For Code Conversion only_ **Choose Your New Programming Language**: select `Boost: Select Output Language` and choose from supported languages, including Python, Java, C\\#, C++, TypeScript, and JavaScript.\n\n    ![Select Your Output Language](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-28_at_9.41.57_PM.jpg?width=500)\n\n\n7. **Run the AI-enabled Analysis and Processing**: For full file analysis across all Cells, click the Boost button `run-all`. Or select a single Boost Notebook cell and click the Boost button `run`.\n\n    ![Analyze a single cell](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-28_at_1.45.43_PM.jpg?width=500)\n\n\n8. **Review the Results**: Each Boost Notebook cell will contain the results of the AI-enhanced processing.\n  * **For Defect and Security Analysis**, you can edit the code in each Cell and re-run the analysis to see the results.\n  * **For Data Compliance**, you can review the data compliance issues in each Cell, and learn more about how your code uses data.\n  * **For Coding Guidelines**, you can review the analysis in each Cell to see how your code follows best practices, or differs from standard coding guidelines.\n  * **For Code Conversion**, you can review the new code in each Cell for integration into your new modernized project.\n  * **For Documentation**, you can read the documentation to better understand legacy code, review for architectural or potential redesign, and to better understand how the original code actually worked.\n  * **For Test Generation**, you can review the test cases and integrate them into your automated test harness or CI/CD/CT system.\n\nIf you encounter any other issues or have questions, please refer to the [Polyverse Boost](https://polyverse.com/pages/boost-visual-studio) website for more information and support options.\n\n*Happy coding!*\n\n## About Polyverse\n\nFounded in 2015 by Alex Gounares, former CTO of AOL and Microsoft Online, and Bill Gates' technology advisor, Polyverse Corporation has been delivering state-of-the-art cybersecurity tools to the Fortune 500 and the US Government.
