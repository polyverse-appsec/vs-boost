### Boost Code Explanation

Last Updated: Friday, September 8, 2023 at 6:18:18 PM PDT

The code you provided is written in TypeScript, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. 

This code defines a custom exception class named `IncompatibleVersionException` that extends the built-in `Error` class in JavaScript. Custom exceptions are useful for creating specific error types that can be caught and handled separately from other errors.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `export class IncompatibleVersionException extends Error`: This line is declaring a class named `IncompatibleVersionException` that inherits from the `Error` class. The `export` keyword is used to make this class available to other modules in the application.

- `constructor(message?: string, expectedVersion?: string, actualVersion?: string)`: This is the constructor of the class, which is a special method that is used to create and initialize an object created from a class. It takes three optional parameters: `message`, `expectedVersion`, and `actualVersion`. The `?` after each parameter name indicates that the parameter is optional.

- `super(message);`: This line is calling the constructor of the parent `Error` class with the `message` parameter. The `super` keyword is used to call methods on a parent class.

- `this.name = 'IncompatibleVersionException';`: This line is setting the `name` property of the error to the string `'IncompatibleVersionException'`. This can be useful when logging or handling errors, as it allows you to determine the type of the error.

- `this.expectedVersion = expectedVersion?expectedVersion:"";`: This line is setting the `expectedVersion` property of the error. If `expectedVersion` is provided, it will be used; otherwise, the property will be set to an empty string.

- `this.actualVersion = actualVersion?actualVersion:"";`: This line is setting the `actualVersion` property of the error in the same way.

- `expectedVersion: string; actualVersion: string;`: These lines are declaring two string properties on the class: `expectedVersion` and `actualVersion`.

This code does not appear to conflict with any architectural guidelines. It follows best practices for defining custom exceptions in TypeScript.
