CMake is a cross-platform build system generator. Scripts written in CMake (files named CMakeLists.txt) are used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.\n\nNow, let's break down the code:\n\n1. `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)`: This command ensures that the version of CMake that is being used to build the project is at least version 3.12. If the version of CMake is lower than this, the configuration process will stop with an error message.\n\n2. `project(MyProject)`: This command sets the name of the project to \"MyProject\". This name is used in several places, such as in the name of the default build target, and in the project call in generated CMake files.\n\n3. `add_executable(myprogram main.cpp)`: This command adds an executable target called \"myprogram\" to be built from the source file \"main.cpp\". The executable will be created when you run the build command.\n\nThe algorithm used here is the basic algorithm of CMake, which is to read and process the CMakeLists.txt file, and then generate the appropriate build files for the system.\n\nAs for architectural guidelines, this script is quite simple and doesn't impose any particular architecture. However, it's good practice to keep your CMakeLists.txt files organized and modular, especially for larger projects.\n\nFor more information on CMake, you can refer to the official documentation: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/\n\nFor more information on the commands used in this script, you can refer to the following links:\n- `cmake_minimum_required`: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html\n- `project`: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html\n- `add_executable`: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html"
