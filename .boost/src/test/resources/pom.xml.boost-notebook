It is often unique amongst an organization or a project. For example, all core Java packages start with 'java.' or 'javax.'.\n- `<artifactId>`: This is the id of the artifact (project). It is required and is often the name that the project is known by. For example, a networking project might be called 'networking'.\n- `<version>`: This is the version of the artifact (project). It is required by the POM. It follows a certain format like 'MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH', where each part has a specific meaning. For example, '1.0.0'.\n- `</project>`: This is the end of the root element.\n\nThe POM file is fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects. Examples for this would be the build directory, which is 'target'; the source directory, which is 'src/main/java'; the test source directory, which is 'src/test/java'; and so on. When executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory. It reads the POM, gets the needed configuration information, then executes the goal.\n\nYou can find more information about POM files in Maven from the official Apache Maven documentation: [Introduction to the POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html)"
