It's a part of a larger software project and this snippet of code represents the import statements at the top of a file.\n\nThe code is importing a module named `path` from Node.js standard library. The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It can be used for tasks such as joining, normalizing, and resolving paths. More information about the `path` module can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).\n\nThe code then imports two specific exports, `KernelControllerBase` and `markdownMimeType`, from a local module located at `./base_controller`. The `./` at the beginning of the string indicates that `base_controller` is a local file in the same directory as the current file.\n\n`KernelControllerBase` is likely a base class or interface for a controller in the software project. A controller is a common pattern in software design, especially in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectures, where it acts as an intermediary between the model (data) and the view (user interface). Controllers handle user input and update the model and view accordingly.\n\n`markdownMimeType` is likely a string constant that represents the MIME type for Markdown files. MIME types are used in HTTP to indicate the type of data being transmitted, so that it can be correctly processed by the recipient. The MIME type for Markdown is usually `text/markdown`.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to say exactly how these imports are being used in the rest of the file, but they are likely used in the implementation of a controller that handles Markdown files.\n\nThe code appears to be in line with standard practices for TypeScript and Node.js projects, and doesn't seem to conflict with any architectural guidelines based on the information provided."

To understand this line of code, let's break it down:\n\n`import { getAllProjectFiles } from '../utilities/files';`\n\n- `import` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript used to import functions, objects, or values from modules or packages. \n\n- `{ getAllProjectFiles }` is the specific function that is being imported. The curly braces are used for named exports. In this case, `getAllProjectFiles` is a named export from the module we are importing from.\n\n- `from '../utilities/files';` specifies the path to the module or package from which the function is being imported. The `'../'` part of the path means that the module is in the parent directory of the current file. The `'utilities/files'` part of the path means that the module is named 'files' and is located in a directory named 'utilities'.\n\nThe `getAllProjectFiles` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on its name, we can infer that it's likely a function that retrieves all files in a project. The exact details of how it does this would depend on the implementation of the function in the 'files' module.\n\nAs for the algorithm used in this line of code, it's not an algorithm in the traditional sense. It's a part of the module system in JavaScript, which is a way of organizing and sharing code. The module system uses algorithms under the hood to resolve import paths and load modules, but these are part of the JavaScript runtime and not something that developers typically need to think about.\n\nFor more information on the `import` statement in JavaScript, you can refer to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).\n\nIn terms of the architectural guidelines provided, this line of code seems to follow good practices. It's modular, meaning that the `getAllProjectFiles` function is kept in a separate file and imported where it's needed. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain."

It's part of a larger module that likely interacts with Jupyter notebooks in some way, given the imported types. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as vscode from 'vscode';\n```\n\nThis line imports the entire vscode module. The `vscode` module provides a set of APIs that can be used to interact with Visual Studio Code. This allows the extension to use VS Code's built-in functions and classes.\n\n```javascript\nimport {\n    BoostNotebookCell,\n    BoostNotebook,\n    NotebookCellKind,\n    SerializedNotebookCellOutput } from '../data/jupyter_notebook';\n```\n\nThis line imports specific types from a module located at '../data/jupyter_notebook'. The types imported are likely classes or interfaces that represent different aspects of a Jupyter notebook:\n\n- `BoostNotebookCell`: This likely represents a single cell in a BoostNotebook. In Jupyter notebooks, a cell is the unit of code or text that can be executed independently.\n\n- `BoostNotebook`: This likely represents a BoostNotebook as a whole. It probably includes properties such as an array of cells and methods for manipulating those cells.\n\n- `NotebookCellKind`: This might be an enumeration that represents the type of a cell in a notebook. In Jupyter notebooks, cells can be of different types, such as code cells or markdown cells.\n\n- `SerializedNotebookCellOutput`: This likely represents the output of a cell after it has been executed and serialized (converted into a format that can be stored or transmitted).\n\nThe exact details of these types would be found in the '../data/jupyter_notebook' module.\n\nUnfortunately, without the rest of the code or the project, it's not possible to determine any algorithms used in this code snippet, as it only contains import statements. The algorithms would be found in the functions and methods that use these imported types and the vscode API.\n\nFor more information on the topics mentioned, you can visit the following links:\n\n- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)\n- [Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api)\n- [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)"

This is a common practice in modular programming, where code is separated into logical modules that can be imported and used where needed. \n\nIn the context of JavaScript and TypeScript (the languages used in the project according to the architectural blueprint), the `import` statement is used to bring in functions, objects, or values from another module or file. The `{ boostLogging }` syntax is using destructuring to directly import the `boostLogging` export from the module.\n\nThe module being imported, 'boostLogging', likely contains some sort of logging functionality that is used by the Boost VS Code extension for debugging, error tracking, or usage analytics. Without more code, it's hard to say exactly what this module does, but the name suggests it's related to logging.\n\nThe relative path '../utilities/boostLogging' tells us that the 'boostLogging' module is located in a 'utilities' directory one level up from the current file.\n\nAs for algorithms, this single line of code doesn't really involve any. It's a simple import statement that doesn't perform any complex operations.\n\nFor more information on the `import` statement and modules in JavaScript, you can refer to the Mozilla Developer Network documentation:\n\n- [JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)\n- [import statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, this line of code seems to be in line with the noted architecture of the project. It's a simple, modular approach to code organization, which is a common practice in many JavaScript and TypeScript projects."

The import statement is used to import bindings that are exported by another module.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n- `import`: This is a reserved keyword in JavaScript that is used to import functions, objects, or values from another module or file.\n\n- `{ findCellByKernel }`: This is a named import. It means that the module you are importing from has exported something using the `export` keyword with the name `findCellByKernel`. This could be a function, an object, a class, etc. The curly braces `{}` are used for named imports and can include multiple names separated by commas.\n\n- `from`: This is another reserved keyword used in conjunction with `import`. It specifies the path to the module from which the import will be done.\n\n- `'../extension/extension'`: This is the path to the module file that contains the export. The `..` at the beginning of the path means to go up one directory level. The `/extension/extension` part is the path from there to the module. This is a relative path, meaning it is relative to the file that contains this import statement.\n\nThe line of code does not give information about the algorithm used as it is just an import statement. The algorithm would be in the function or object that is being imported, which is not shown in the provided code.\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, this line of code seems to follow good practices. It imports functionality from another module, which promotes modularity and separation of concerns. These are key principles in many architectural and design patterns.\n\nFor more information about `import` in JavaScript, you can check the following resources:\n\n- [MDN Web Docs: import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n- [JavaScript.info: Modules, import, export](https://javascript.info/modules-intro)"

This is part of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) module system.\n\n2. `{ generateCellOutputWithHeader }`: This is the function that is being imported. The curly braces are used for named exports. In this case, `generateCellOutputWithHeader` is a named export from the module we are importing from.\n\n3. `from '../extension/extensionUtilities';`: This specifies the path to the module from which the function is being imported. The `'../'` part of the path indicates that the module is in the parent directory of the current file. `extension/extensionUtilities` is the directory path and file name of the module.\n\nWithout the body of the `generateCellOutputWithHeader` function or its usage in the code, I can't provide specific details about the algorithm used within it. However, based on its name, we can infer that this function likely generates some form of cell output (possibly for a data grid or table) and includes a header in this output.\n\nThis line of code is consistent with typical JavaScript/TypeScript practices and doesn't seem to conflict with any architectural guidelines based on the information provided. \n\nFor more information on JavaScript modules and import/export statements, you might find the following resources helpful:\n\n- [JavaScript Modules: A Beginner’s Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-modules-a-beginner-s-guide-783f7d7a5fcc/)\n- [MDN Web Docs: import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n- [TypeScript Module Resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)"

It's a bit difficult to provide a detailed analysis or identify any algorithms used based on this single line, but I'll explain what this line is doing in the context of a typical JavaScript or TypeScript program.\n\n```\nimport { getCurrentOrganization } from \"../utilities/authorization\";\n```\n\nThis line of code is using the `import` statement to import a specific function, `getCurrentOrganization`, from a module located at `../utilities/authorization`. The `import` statement is part of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is used to import functions, objects, or values from modules in a JavaScript or TypeScript program.\n\nIn this case, `getCurrentOrganization` is likely a function that retrieves the current organization in the context of an authorization or authentication process. The exact details of what this function does would be found in the `authorization.js` or `authorization.ts` file in the `utilities` directory one level up from the current file.\n\nThe `import` statement helps to organize code into reusable modules. This is a common practice in JavaScript and TypeScript and aligns with the principles of modular design and code reuse. It's also a good practice in terms of security, as it allows for specific parts of code (modules) to be exposed while keeping the rest private.\n\nFor more information on the `import` statement and modules in JavaScript, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [MDN Web Docs: import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n- [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, this line of code seems to align with general good practices in software development such as modular design, code reuse, and security considerations. It doesn't appear to conflict with any common architectural guidelines or constraints. However, without the specific architectural guidelines for this project, it's hard to say definitively."

It's written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types and other features to the language.\n\nThe code is importing a type named `ControllerOutputType` from a module named `controllerOutputTypes`. This type is likely used to annotate variables, function parameters, or function return values in the code that follows.\n\nThe `import` statement is a part of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) modules syntax. Modules are a way to share code between files. This is a static import statement, which means it will be executed when the module is loaded.\n\nThe `{ ControllerOutputType }` syntax is called named import. It means that the `controllerOutputTypes` module exports something named `ControllerOutputType`, and we want to import that specific thing. If there were other exports from `controllerOutputTypes`, this import statement wouldn't include them.\n\nThe `'./controllerOutputTypes'` string is a path to the module we're importing from. The `./` part means that the module is in the same directory as the current file.\n\nAs for the `ControllerOutputType` itself, without more context, it's impossible to say what exactly it represents. It's likely to be an enumeration or a type alias that specifies what kind of outputs a controller can produce.\n\nHere are some resources for further reading:\n- [TypeScript Handbook: Modules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html)\n- [MDN Web Docs: import statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n- [TypeScript Handbook: Advanced Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) (for more information on type aliases and other advanced types)"

It's importing a named export `DisplayGroupFriendlyName` from a module located at `../data/userAnalysisType`.\n\nThe `DisplayGroupFriendlyName` is likely a function, constant, or class that's been exported from the `userAnalysisType` module, which is located in the `data` directory one level up from the current file. The exact nature and use of `DisplayGroupFriendlyName` would be determined by looking at the `userAnalysisType` module.\n\nThe ES6 module system is a way of organizing and sharing code in JavaScript. Each file is treated as a separate module and can export functions, objects, or values which can then be imported by other modules. This system allows for code reuse, encapsulation, and separation of concerns.\n\nIn terms of architectural guidelines, this import statement is consistent with common practices in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It's using relative paths, which is typical in Node.js environments, and it's using the ES6 import syntax, which is widely supported and often preferred over the older CommonJS `require()` syntax.\n\nFor more information on ES6 import/export syntax, you might find the following resources helpful:\n\n- [MDN Web Docs: import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n- [MDN Web Docs: export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)\n- [Exploring JS: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)"

It defines a class `BoostQuickSummaryKernelControllerBase` which extends `KernelControllerBase`. This class is responsible for executing a quick summary analysis on a given project or source file.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the class:\n\n1. **Constructor**: The constructor sets up the instance of the class. It calls the parent class constructor and sets up some instance variables. It also initializes the parent controller.\n\n2. **dispose method**: This method is used to clean up resources when the instance of the class is no longer needed.\n\n3. **serviceEndpoint**: This getter returns the URL of the remote service endpoint based on the configuration setting `BoostConfiguration.cloudServiceStage`.\n\n4. **executeAll method**: This asynchronous method is the main entry point for executing the quick summary analysis. It validates the input, prepares the payload for the remote service, and handles errors.\n\n5. **parentController**: This getter returns the parent controller of the instance. It throws an error if the parent controller is not found.\n\n6. **_runQuickSummary method**: This private asynchronous method runs the quick summary analysis. It sends the payload to the remote service, processes the response, and updates the notebook.\n\n7. **buildDefaultOfflineSummary method**: This method builds a default offline summary when no files are available for analysis or when no severe issues are found.\n\n8. **onKernelOutputItem method**: This method processes the response from the remote service and generates the output.\n\n9. **getTopSeverityIssues method**: This method gets the top severity issues from a collection of diagnostics. It filters, sorts, and maps the issues to a specific format.\n\nThe algorithms used in this code are mainly related to data manipulation, such as filtering, sorting, and mapping. The code also uses asynchronous programming for potentially long-running tasks, such as communicating with the remote service.\n\nFor more information about TypeScript, you can visit [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).\nFor more information about Visual Studio Code Extensions, you can visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).\nFor more information about asynchronous programming, you can visit [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts).\n\nThis TypeScript code is part of a class (not shown in the provided code). It contains two methods: `getListOfIssues` and `getTableOfIssuesBySeverityAndCategory`. Both methods are used to process diagnostics (issues) in a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) project and return a JSON string representation of the processed data.\n\nThe first method, `getListOfIssues`, takes a `vscode.DiagnosticCollection` and an optional `sourceFileTarget` as parameters. It processes each diagnostic in the collection and maps it to a new object with properties `filename`, `category`, `severity`, `message`, and `relatedInformation`. The severity of the diagnostic is converted from an enum to a string, and the resulting array of objects is then converted to a JSON string.\n\nThe second method, `getTableOfIssuesBySeverityAndCategory`, also takes a `vscode.DiagnosticCollection` and an optional `sourceFileTarget` as parameters. It processes the diagnostics in a slightly different way. First, it flattens the diagnostics from the collection into a single array. If a `sourceFileTarget` is provided, only diagnostics for that file are included.\n\nNext, it initializes an empty object to store counts of issues by severity, category, and filename. It then iterates over all diagnostics, converting the severity from an enum to a string and categorizing the issues. If the severity, category, or filename doesn't yet exist in the result object, it is initialized. Finally, the count of issues for each combination of severity, category, and filename is incremented.\n\nThe object storing the counts is then converted to a JSON string and returned. If there were no diagnostics, an empty JSON array string is returned.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is essentially a multi-level grouping operation. It groups the diagnostics first by severity, then by category, and finally by filename. For each group, it counts the number of diagnostics.\n\nFor more information on the VSCode API used in this code, see the following links:\n- [VSCode API - Diagnostics](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Diagnostic)\n- [VSCode API - DiagnosticCollection](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DiagnosticCollection)\n- [VSCode API - DiagnosticSeverity](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DiagnosticSeverity)"

The primary path through the code is shown with the `ExampleProcess` style, while the alternate non-error paths are shown with the default non-colored style. Error paths are shown with the `ExampleErrorPath` style.\n\nThe control flow starts at the `executeAll` function and follows the primary path through the code. It first checks if the `notebook` is an instance of `BoostNotebook`. If not, it throws an error. Then, it checks if `forceAnalysisRefresh` is `true` and sets it to `true` regardless. Next, it checks if `usingBoostNotebook` is `false` and throws an error if it is. It then awaits the result of the `_runQuickSummary` function and handles any errors that occur. Finally, it logs the completion of the function and returns `true`.\n\nThe `_runQuickSummary` function is called within the `executeAll` function. It first checks if `this.parentController` is defined and throws an error if it is not. It then checks if `filteredFiles` is not empty and if `topSeverityIssues` is not an empty array. If both conditions are true, it executes the quick report service and handles any errors that occur. After that, it finds or creates a target cell in the notebook and updates its output with the results of the quick summary. Finally, it flushes the notebook to the file system.\n\nThe control flow diagram does not show any external library or non-standard function calls.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\nstyle Start fill:#228B22, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;\nstyle ExampleProcess fill:#228B22, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:4px;\nstyle ExampleErrorPath fill:#B22222, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;\nstyle ExternalLibrary fill:#FFA500, stroke:#000000, stroke-width:2px;\n\nStart-->A;\nA-->B;\nB-->C;\nC-->D;\nD-->E;\nE-->F;\nF-->G;\nG-->H;\nH-->I;\nI-->J;\nJ-->K;\nK-->L;\nL-->M;\nM-->N;\nN-->O;\nO-->P;\nP-->Q;\nQ-->R;\nR-->S;\nS-->T;\nT-->U;\nU-->V;\nV-->W;\nW-->X;\nX-->Y;\nY-->Z;\nZ-->AA;\nAA-->AB;\nAB-->AC;\nAC-->AD;\nAD-->AE;\nAE-->AF;\nAF-->AG;\nAG-->AH;\nAH-->AI;\nAI-->AJ;\nAJ-->AK;\nAK-->AL;\nAL-->AM;\nAM-->AN;\nAN-->AO;\nAO-->AP;\nAP-->AQ;\nAQ-->AR;\nAR-->AS;\nAS-->AT;\nAT-->AU;\nAU-->AV;\nAV-->AW;\nAW-->AX;\nAX-->AY;\nAY-->AZ;\nAZ-->BA;\nBA-->BB;\nBB-->BC;\nBC-->BD;\nBD-->BE;\nBE-->BF;\nBF-->BG;\nBG-->BH;\nBH-->BI;\nBI-->BJ;\nBJ-->BK;\nBK-->BL;\nBL-->BM;\nBM-->BN;\nBN-->BO;\nBO-->BP;\nBP-->BQ;\nBQ-->BR;\nBR-->BS;\nBS-->BT;\nBT-->BU;\nBU-->BV;\nBV-->BW;\nBW-->BX;\nBX-->BY;\nBY-->BZ;\nBZ-->CA;\nCA-->CB;\nCB-->CC;\nCC-->CD;\nCD-->CE;\nCE-->CF;\nCF-->CG;\nCG-->CH;\nCH-->CI;\nCI-->CJ;\nCJ-->CK;\nCK-->CL;\nCL-->CM;\nCM-->CN;\nCN-->CO;\nCO-->CP;\nCP-->CQ;\nCQ-->CR;\nCR-->CS;\nCS-->CT;\nCT-->CU;\nCU-->CV;\nCV-->CW;\nCW-->CX;\nCX-->CY;\nCY-->CZ;\nCZ-->DA;\nDA-->DB;\nDB-->DC;\nDC-->DD;\nDD-->DE;\nDE-->DF;\nDF-->DG;\nDG-->DH;\nDH-->DI;\nDI-->DJ;\nDJ-->DK;\nDK-->DL;\nDL-->DM;\nDM-->DN;\nDN-->DO;\nDO-->DP;\nDP-->DQ;\nDQ-->DR;\nDR-->DS;\nDS-->DT;\nDT-->DU;\nDU-->DV;\nDV-->DW;\nDW-->DX;\nDX-->DY;\nDY-->DZ;\nDZ-->EA;\nEA-->EB;\nEB-->EC;\nEC-->ED;\nED-->EE;\nEE-->EF;\nEF-->EG;\nEG-->EH;\nEH-->EI;\nEI-->EJ;\nEJ-->EK;\nEK-->EL;\nEL-->EM;\nEM-->EN;\nEN-->EO;\nEO-->EP;\nEP-->EQ;\nEQ-->ER;\nER-->ES;\nES-->ET;\nET-->EU;\nEU-->EV;\nEV-->EW;\nEW-->EX;\nEX-->EY;\nEY-->EZ;\nEZ-->FA;\nFA-->FB;\nFB-->FC;\nFC-->FD;\nFD-->FE;\nFE-->FF;\nFF-->FG;\nFG-->FH;\nFH-->FI;\nFI-->FJ;\nFJ-->FK;\nFK-->FL;\nFL-->FM;\nFM-->FN;\nFN-->FO;\nFO-->FP;\nFP-->FQ;\nFQ-->FR;\nFR-->FS;\nFS-->FT;\nFT-->FU;\nFU-->FV;\nFV-->FW;\nFW-->FX;\nFX-->FY;\nFY-->FZ;\nFZ-->GA;\nGA-->GB;\nGB-->GC;\nGC-->GD;\nGD-->GE;\nGE-->GF;\nGF-->GG;\nGG-->GH;\nGH-->GI;\nGI-->GJ;\nGJ-->GK;\nGK-->GL;\nGL-->GM;\nGM-->GN;\nGN-->GO;\nGO-->GP;\nGP-->GQ;\nGQ-->GR;\nGR-->GS;\nGS-->GT;\nGT-->GU;\nGU-->GV;\nGV-->GW;\nGW-->GX;\nGX-->GY;\nGY-->GZ;\nGZ-->HA;\nHA-->HB;\nHB-->HC;\nHC-->HD;\nHD-->HE;\nHE-->HF;\nHF-->HG;\nHG-->HH;\nHH-->HI;\nHI-->HJ;\nHJ-->HK;\nHK-->HL;\nHL-->HM;\nHM-->HN;\nHN-->HO;\nHO-->HP;\nHP-->HQ;\nHQ-->HR;\nHR-->HS;\nHS-->HT;\nHT-->HU;\nHU-->HV;\nHV-->HW;\nHW-->HX;\nHX-->HY;\nHY-->HZ;\nHZ-->IA;\nIA-->IB;\nIB-->IC;\nIC-->ID;\nID-->IE;\nIE-->IF;\nIF-->IG;\nIG-->IH;\nIH-->II;\nII-->IJ;\nIJ-->IK;\nIK-->IL;\nIL-->IM;\nIM-->IN;\nIN-->IO;\nIO-->IP;\nIP-->IQ;\nIQ-->IR;\nIR-->IS;\nIS-->IT;\nIT-->IU;\nIU-->IV;\nIV-->IW;\nIW-->IX;\nIX-->IY;\nIY-->IZ;\nIZ-->JA;\nJA-->JB;\nJB-->JC;\nJC-->JD;\nJD-->JE;\nJE-->JF;\nJF-->JG;\nJG-->JH;\nJH-->JI;\nJI-->JJ;\nJJ-->JK;\nJK-->JL;\nJL-->JM;\nJM-->JN;\nJN-->JO;\nJO-->JP;\nJP-->JQ;\nJQ-->JR;\nJR-->JS;\nJS-->JT;\nJT-->JU;\nJU-->JV;\nJV-->JW;\nJW-->JX;\nJX-->JY;\nJY-->JZ;\nJZ-->KA;\nKA-->KB;\nKB-->KC;\nKC-->KD;\nKD-->KE;\nKE-->KF;\nKF-->KG;\nKG-->KH;\nKH-->KI;\nKI-->KJ;\nKJ-->KK;\nKK-->KL;\nKL-->KM;\nKM-->KN;\nKN-->KO;\nKO-->KP;\nKP-->KQ;\nKQ-->KR;\nKR-->KS;\nKS-->KT;\nKT-->KU;\nKU-->KV;\nKV-->KW;\nKW-->KX;\nKX-->KY;\nKY-->KZ;\nKZ-->LA;\nLA-->LB;\nLB-->LC;\nLC-->LD;\nLD-->LE;\nLE-->LF;\nLF-->LG;\nLG-->LH;\nLH-->LI;\nLI-->LJ;\nLJ-->LK;\nLK-->LL;\nLL-->LM;\nLM-->LN;\nLN-->LO;\nLO-->LP;\nLP-->LQ;\nLQ-->LR;\nLR-->LS;\nLS-->LT;\nLT-->LU;\nLU-->LV;\nLV-->LW;\nLW-->LX;\nLX-->LY;\nLY-->LZ;\nLZ-->MA;\nMA-->MB;\nMB-->MC;\nMC-->MD;\nMD-->ME;\nME-->MF;\nMF-->MG;\nMG-->MH;\nMH-->MI;\nMI-->MJ;\nMJ-->MK;\nMK-->ML;\nML-->MM;\nMM-->MN;\nMN-->MO;\nMO-->MP;\nMP-->MQ;\nMQ-->MR;\nMR-->MS;\nMS-->MT;\nMT-->MU;\nMU-->MV;\nMV-->MW;\nMW-->MX;\nMX-->MY;\nMY-->MZ;\nMZ-->NA;\nNA-->NB;\nNB-->NC;\nNC-->ND;\nND-->NE;\nNE-->NF;\nNF-->NG;\nNG-->NH;\nNH-->NI;\nNI-->NJ;\nNJ-->NK;\nNK-->NL;\nNL-->NM;\nNM-->NN;\nNN-->NO;\nNO-->NP;\nNP-->NQ;\nNQ-->NR;\nNR-->NS;\nNS-->NT;\nNT-->NU;\nNU-->NV;\nNV-->NW;\nNW-->NX;\nNX-->NY;\nNY-->NZ;\nNZ-->OA;\nOA-->OB;\nOB-->OC;\nOC-->OD;\nOD-->OE;\nOE-->OF;\nOF-->OG;\nOG-->OH;\nOH-->OI;\nOI-->OJ;\nOJ-->OK;\nOK-->OL;\nOL-->"
