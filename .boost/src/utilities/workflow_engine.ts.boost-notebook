The execution pattern is based on a pattern array, where each element represents the number of main promises to be run in sequence before running all the afterEachGroup promises.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n1. **Initialization:** The engine is initialized with several arrays of promise generators:\n   - `before`: These promises are run at the very beginning of the workflow.\n   - `main`: This is the main group of promise generators.\n   - `afterEachGroup`: These promises are run after each group of main promises, as specified by the pattern.\n   - `after`: These promises are run at the end of the workflow.\n   - `pattern`: This array specifies the grouping for the main array.\n\n2. **Running the Workflow:** \n   - First, all the `before` promises are run.\n   - Then, the `main` promises are run in groups as specified by the `pattern`. After each group, all `afterEachGroup` promises are run.\n   - If any promise in the `main` array fails, its generator is re-run, and a new promise is added to the queue.\n   - Finally, all the `after` promises are run.\n\n3. **Abort:** If the abort API is called, the workflow will stop executing further promises.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a form of the **Serial Execution Pattern** for promises, where promises are executed one after the other, in a specific order. The twist here is that the number of promises to be executed in each batch is dynamic and determined by the `pattern` array. \n\nThe `import { all } from \"micromatch\";` line at the end imports the `all` function from the `micromatch` library, which is a glob matching library. However, based on the given code and description, it's not clear how this function is used in the workflow engine.\n\nFor more information on promises and their execution patterns, you can refer to these resources:\n- [Promises in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\n- [Serial Execution with Promises](https://decembersoft.com/posts/promises-in-serial-with-array-reduce/)\n- [Micromatch library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromatch)"

It's not really an algorithm, but it's a crucial part of many programs.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n```import { v4 as uuidv4 } from \"uuid\";```\n\nThis statement is importing a specific function `v4` from the `uuid` module. This function is used to generate random UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). The `as uuidv4` part means that, within the scope of this file, the `v4` function will be referred to as `uuidv4`. This is a feature of JavaScript's import syntax that allows you to rename imports. \n\nThe `uuid` module is a popular JavaScript library for creating UUIDs. UUIDs are used in software development for various purposes, such as to provide a unique identifier for objects, to generate random keys for access tokens, etc.\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, this single line of code doesn't reveal much about the architecture of the software project. However, the usage of ES6 import statement and the `uuid` library are typical in modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects.\n\nFor more information about `uuid`, you can visit the npm (Node Package Manager) page for the library: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)\n\nFor more information about ES6 import/export syntax, you can visit: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)"

This class extends the built-in JavaScript `Error` class, which means it inherits all of the properties and methods of that class, but also adds some additional functionality.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `export class WorkflowError extends Error`: This line of code is defining a new class `WorkflowError` that extends the built-in JavaScript `Error` class. The `export` keyword means that this class can be imported and used in other TypeScript or JavaScript files.\n\n2. `constructor(public type: \"retry\" | \"skip\" | \"abort\" | \"cancel\", message?: string)`: This is the constructor of the `WorkflowError` class. The constructor is a special method that gets called when a new instance of the class is created.\n\n    - `public type: \"retry\" | \"skip\" | \"abort\" | \"cancel\"`: This is defining a public instance variable `type` that can take one of four string values: \"retry\", \"skip\", \"abort\", or \"cancel\". The `public` keyword means that this variable can be accessed directly on instances of the class.\n   \n    - `message?: string`: This is defining an optional parameter `message` that can be passed when instantiating the class. The `?` after `message` indicates that this parameter is optional. If a message is provided, it will be passed to the `Error` class constructor, which will set it as the error message.\n\n3. `super(message);`: This line of code is calling the constructor of the parent `Error` class. The `super` keyword is used to call methods on a class's parent. In this case, it's passing the optional `message` parameter to the `Error` class's constructor.\n\nThis class can be used to throw custom errors in a workflow, where the type of error (retry, skip, abort, cancel) can be used to decide how to handle the error.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this class:\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n    // Some code that might throw an error\n    throw new WorkflowError('abort', 'Something went wrong');\n} catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof WorkflowError) {\n        switch (error.type) {\n            case 'abort':\n                // Handle abort error\n                break;\n            // Other cases...\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Handle other types of errors\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on TypeScript classes, see the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html)."

The constructor also takes an optional `message` parameter.\n\nThe control flow starts at the `Start` node and then goes to the `HandleError` node. From the `HandleError` node, there are four possible paths based on the value of the `type` parameter:\n\n- If the `type` is \"retry\", the control flow goes to the `HandleRetry` node and then to the `End` node.\n- If the `type` is \"skip\", the control flow goes to the `HandleSkip` node and then to the `End` node.\n- If the `type` is \"abort\", the control flow goes to the `HandleAbort` node and then to the `End` node.\n- If the `type` is \"cancel\", the control flow goes to the `HandleCancel` node and then to the `End` node.\n\nThe `End` node represents the end of the control flow.\n\nNote: Since the code provided does not have any external library calls or non-standard function calls, the control flow graph only includes the custom error class and its constructor."

This type of code is commonly used in designing and implementing a system that processes tasks in a certain order, often with dependencies between tasks. Here is a detailed explanation:\n\n1. `PromiseGenerator`: This is a type alias for a function that returns another function, which when called, returns a Promise. Promises in JavaScript are used for asynchronous computations and can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n2. `PromiseGeneratorWithInputs`: Similar to `PromiseGenerator`, but the returned function takes an array of inputs.\n\n3. `BeforeRunPromiseGenerator`, `AfterEachTaskPromiseGenerator`, `AfterEachTaskGroupPromiseGenerator`, `AfterRunPromiseGenerator`: These are simply aliases for the previously defined types. Their names suggest their intended use in a workflow engine, for example, to generate promises that should be resolved before running a task, after each task, after each group of tasks, and after all tasks have been run, respectively.\n\n4. `WorkflowEngineOptions`: This is an interface that defines a shape for an options object that can be passed to a Workflow Engine. The options include:\n   - `beforeRun`, `afterEachTask`, `afterEachTaskGroup`, `afterRun`: These are arrays of functions that return promises, which can be used to perform setup and teardown operations around tasks and groups of tasks.\n   - `pattern`: An array of numbers, possibly used to determine the order in which tasks are run.\n   - `logger`: An object used for logging, its type is not specified.\n   - `maxRetries`: The maximum number of times a task should be retried on failure.\n   - `name`: The name of the workflow.\n\nThe code does not include any specific algorithms, but it sets up the types and structures for a workflow engine that could be used to orchestrate complex asynchronous tasks. This type of engine could be used in a variety of contexts, such as processing user requests in a web server, running tasks in a build system, or orchestrating microservices in a distributed system.\n\nFor more information on Promises and asynchronous programming in JavaScript, you can refer to the following resources:\n- Promises: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\n- Asynchronous Programming: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous\n\nFor more information on TypeScript types and interfaces, you can refer to the official TypeScript documentation:\n- TypeScript Types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html\n- TypeScript Interfaces: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html"

It calculates and returns the elapsed time, in either seconds or minutes, since a given start time.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function `getElapsedTime` accepts one parameter, `startTime`, which is of type `number`. This parameter represents the start time in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970). \n\n2. The first line within the function calculates the elapsed time in milliseconds by subtracting the `startTime` from the current time (obtained by `Date.now()`). `Date.now()` returns the current time in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.\n\n3. The next line converts the elapsed time from milliseconds to seconds by dividing by 1000 (since there are 1000 milliseconds in one second).\n\n4. An `if` statement checks if the elapsed time in seconds is less than 110. If it is, the function returns the elapsed time in seconds, formatted as a string with two decimal places (e.g., \"10.50 secs\"). \n\n5. If the elapsed time in seconds is 110 or more, the function calculates the elapsed time in minutes by dividing the elapsed seconds by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in one minute) and returns it as a string with two decimal places (e.g., \"1.83 mins\").\n\nThis function does not use any specific algorithms but is a simple calculation and conversion function. It uses basic arithmetic operations and control flow statements, which are fundamental building blocks in programming.\n\nThe code adheres to the architectural guidelines provided in the blueprint summary. It uses TypeScript, which aligns with the software principles of the project. The function is straightforward and does not involve any complex operations that might affect performance or security.\n\nFor more information on the methods and concepts used in this function, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now): This link provides more information on the `Date.now()` method in JavaScript, which returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.\n- [toFixed()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed): This link provides more information on the `toFixed()` method in JavaScript, which formats a number using fixed-point notation.\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/): This link provides more information on TypeScript, the programming language used in this code."

The tasks are represented as promises, and the engine provides functionality for executing these tasks in a specific order and handling errors and retries.\n\nThe `WorkflowEngine` class has several private properties:\n\n- `beforeRun`, `afterEachTask`, `afterEachTaskGroup`, and `afterRun` are arrays of promise generators that represent tasks to be executed at different stages of the workflow.\n- `tasks` is an array of promises that represent the main tasks of the workflow.\n- `pattern` is an array of numbers that defines the group sizes for executing the tasks.\n- `aborted` and `canceled` are boolean flags that indicate whether the workflow has been aborted or canceled.\n- `logger` is an object used for logging.\n- `maxRetries` is the maximum number of retries for a task.\n- `retryCounts` is a map that keeps track of the number of retries for each task.\n- `id` is a unique identifier for the workflow.\n\nThe constructor initializes these properties based on the provided tasks and options.\n\nThe `run` method is the main method of the class. It executes the workflow by running the tasks in the order defined by the `pattern` array. It also handles errors and retries. If an error occurs during the execution of a task, the engine will retry the task up to `maxRetries` times. If the maximum number of retries is reached, the engine will skip the task and continue with the next one. If a task throws a `WorkflowError` with a type of \"abort\", the engine will abort the entire workflow. If the error type is \"cancel\", the engine will cancel the current task and group, but still perform end-of-group and end-of-workflow tasks.\n\nThe `executePromises` and `executePromisesWithInputs` methods are helper methods that execute an array of promise generators, optionally with inputs. They also check the `aborted` flag before each execution, and return immediately if the workflow has been aborted.\n\nThe `abort` and `cancel` methods set the `aborted` and `canceled` flags, respectively.\n\nThe `currentTaskRetries` getter returns the number of retries for the current task.\n\nThe algorithm used in this code is a kind of task scheduling algorithm, where tasks are grouped and executed in a specific order, with error handling and retries. It's a common pattern in workflow management systems.\n\nHere are some links for further reading:\n\n- [Task scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing))\n- [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\n- [Error handling in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling)\n- [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)"
