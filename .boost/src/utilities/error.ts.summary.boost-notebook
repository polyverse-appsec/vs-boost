This file represents 100% of the project's source code, indicating a significant risk if these issues are not addressed.\n\n2. **Potential Customer Impact**: The identified issues relate to the logging of potentially sensitive data. If this data includes personal or cardholder information, it could lead to serious breaches of customer privacy and trust, as well as potential legal and financial penalties for non-compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA regulations.\n\n3. **Architectural Consistency**: The project appears to follow best practices for a Visual Studio Code extension, with a focus on object-oriented design and event-driven programming. However, the identified issues suggest a potential conflict with these principles, as the logging of sensitive data could be seen as a failure to properly encapsulate and protect user data.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Given that the identified issues are present in 100% of the project's source files, the overall health of the project source is at risk. The severity of the issues, classified as \"Warning\", suggests that they should be addressed as soon as possible to mitigate potential risks.\n\n5. **Recommendations**: The project should implement a secure logging mechanism that can redact sensitive information, and ensure that no personal or cardholder data is included in log data. This would help to address the identified issues and bring the project into compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA regulations.\n\n## Overall Issues\n\nThe project's main issue is the potential logging of sensitive data, which could lead to breaches of GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA regulations. This issue is present in the project's only source file, `src/utilities/error.ts`, and should be addressed as a priority to mitigate potential risks.",
