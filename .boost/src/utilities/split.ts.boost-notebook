It contains two import statements that are used to include external modules into the code. \n\n1. `import * as path from \"path\";`\n\n   This statement imports the built-in `path` module from Node.js. The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It's being imported with the `*` syntax, which means that all exported members of the `path` module are being imported as an object named `path`. This object can then be used to access the functions and properties provided by the `path` module. You can learn more about the `path` module from the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).\n\n2. `import { getEncoding } from \"js-tiktoken\";`\n\n   This statement imports a specific function named `getEncoding` from the `js-tiktoken` module. The `js-tiktoken` module is not a built-in module, so it must be a third-party module that is installed as a dependency of the project. The `getEncoding` function is likely to be used later in the code to determine the character encoding of a string or a file. Unfortunately, there isn't much information available online about `js-tiktoken`, so it's hard to provide more specific details about what `getEncoding` does without seeing more of the code.\n\nThe code snippet provided does not include any algorithms. It's simply importing modules that will be used later in the code. \n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since no special guidelines or constraints are provided, the analysis is based on general software development principles. The code snippet adheres to these principles as it properly imports required modules, which promotes modularity and code reuse. \n\nFor more educational resources, you can refer to the following links:\n- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)\n- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/)\n- [ES6 import statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)\n- [JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)"

This is a function type that takes a string as input and returns a tuple of an array of strings and an array of numbers.\n\n```typescript\ntype CodeParser = (code: string) => [string[], number[]];\n```\n\nThe `getEncoding` function is called with the argument \"cl100k_base\" and its return value is assigned to the constant `enc`. This function is not defined in the provided code, but it looks like it's used to get some kind of encoding scheme. \n\n```typescript\nconst enc = getEncoding(\"cl100k_base\");\n```\n\nThe constant `maxTokenAggregationLength` is set to 2500. This could be a configuration setting that determines the maximum length of aggregated tokens in the code analysis process.\n\n```typescript\nconst maxTokenAggregationLength = 2500;\n```\n\nThe `getFileExtension` function takes a filename as a string and returns the file extension. It does this by finding the last index of the period character (\".\") in the filename, and then slicing the string from that index plus one to the end. If there is no period in the filename, it returns an empty string.\n\n```typescript\nfunction getFileExtension(filename: string): string {\n    const lastIndex = filename.lastIndexOf(\".\");\n    return lastIndex !== -1 ? filename.slice(lastIndex + 1) : \"\";\n}\n```\n\nThe `lastIndexOf` method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if the element is not present. The `slice` method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string. \n\nFor more information, you can refer to the following links:\n- [TypeScript Function Type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#function-types)\n- [JavaScript String lastIndexOf Method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_lastindexof.asp)\n- [JavaScript String slice Method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_string.asp) \n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, there are no conflicts between the code and the guidelines provided. The code is well-structured and follows common practices in TypeScript, such as defining type aliases and constants, and using string methods for data manipulation."

This function takes a filename as input and returns the corresponding language ID that Visual Studio Code uses internally to identify the language of the file. \n\nThe function works by first extracting the file extension from the filename using a helper function `getFileExtension()`. If no file extension is found, it uses the Node.js `path.parse()` method to extract the filename without the extension and uses this as the file extension. If the filename doesn't contain an extension, `path.basename()` is used to get the last part of the path as the file extension.\n\nThe function then defines an object `languageMappings` that maps file extensions to Visual Studio Code language IDs. For example, files with the extension `.js` are identified as `javascript`, files with the extension `.ts` are identified as `typescript`, and so on. \n\nThe function concludes by returning the language ID corresponding to the file extension of the input filename. If the file extension is not found in the `languageMappings` object, it defaults to `plaintext`.\n\nThis function uses a straightforward lookup algorithm, with a time complexity of O(1) for looking up the language ID in the `languageMappings` object.\n\nHere are some useful links for further reading:\n- [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)\n- [Visual Studio Code Language Identifiers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers)\n- [Node.js path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)\n\nThis code aligns with the architectural guidelines provided in the project blueprint summary.

The function returns a tuple with a string and two arrays of strings and numbers respectively.\n\nThe first thing the function does is determine the language ID of the file based on its filename using the `getVSCodeLanguageId` function. \n\nNext, it sets up a dictionary of parsers, where the keys are language names and the values are functions that parse code of that language into a tuple of strings and numbers. The languages supported here are Python, Ruby, PHP, VB, Perl, Objective-C, and Go.\n\nThe function also defines a set of languages which it categorizes as \"C-style\" languages, including C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, and CoffeeScript.\n\nThe function then selects a parser based on the language ID. If the language ID is in the set of C-style languages, it uses the `splitCode` function as the parser. Otherwise, it looks up the parser in the dictionary of parsers. \n\nIf a parser is found, it is used to parse the code. If the `aggregationEnabled` flag is `true`, the function uses the `splitCodeWithAggregation` function instead of the selected parser. The parsed code and line numbers are returned as part of the output tuple.\n\nIf the language ID is \"plaintext\", the function treats the code as plaintext and doesn't parse it. It returns the entire code as a single string in an array, along with a line number of 0.\n\nIf no parser is found and the language is not \"plaintext\", the function uses the `splitCode` function to parse the code, similarly taking into account the `aggregationEnabled` flag. The parsed code and line numbers are returned as part of the output tuple.\n\nThe algorithm used here is essentially a decision tree, where the decision on how to parse the code is based on the language ID and whether aggregation is enabled.\n\nFor more information on decision trees, you can refer to this link: [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)\n\nFor more information on TypeScript, you can refer to this link: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)"

The function also takes into account the line numbers of the original code. The function returns an array of two arrays: the first one contains the split strings and the second one contains the corresponding line numbers.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. The function receives two parameters: `splitCode`, which is a function that is supposed to split the code into smaller parts, and `code`, which is the code to be split.\n\n2. The `splitCode` function is then called with `code` as its parameter. The result is stored in `splitResults`. This result is expected to be a tuple of two arrays: the first one contains the strings of the split code and the second one contains the corresponding line numbers.\n\n3. The `splitResults` tuple is then destructured into `originalStrings` and `lineNumbers`.\n\n4. The function then initializes `newSplitResults` to hold the new split results, `currentString` to hold the current string being processed, and `currentLineNumber` to hold the current line number.\n\n5. The function then starts a loop over `originalStrings`. For each string, it concatenates it with `currentString` and checks the token count of the resulting string using `enc.encode(aggregatedString).length`.\n\n6. If the token count is less than or equal to `maxTokenAggregationLength`, the function updates `currentString` with `aggregatedString` and, if `currentString` was empty, updates `currentLineNumber` with `originalLineNumber`.\n\n7. If the token count is greater than `maxTokenAggregationLength`, the function pushes `currentString` and `currentLineNumber` into `newSplitResults`, and then updates `currentString` and `currentLineNumber` with `originalString` and `originalLineNumber`, respectively. It then checks the token count of `currentString` and, if it's greater than `maxTokenAggregationLength`, pushes `currentString` and `originalLineNumber` into `newSplitResults` and resets `currentString`.\n\n8. After the loop, if `currentString` is not empty, it is pushed into `newSplitResults` along with `currentLineNumber`.\n\n9. Finally, `newSplitResults` is returned.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a form of the sliding window algorithm, where the window size is determined by the token count of the aggregated string.\n\nHere are some resources for further understanding:\n\n- [Sliding Window Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/)\n- [TypeScript Tuples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#tuple)\n- [Array.prototype.push()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)"

It keeps track of the current chunk of code and the line number where the chunk starts. It also keeps track of the nesting level of the code using curly braces `{}` as indicators of nesting.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. It first checks a boolean flag `useNewParser`. If this flag is `true`, it calls a function `parseCode` with the arguments `\"javascript\"` and the input code, and then returns the result. This appears to be a placeholder for switching to a new code parsing algorithm in the future. The `parseCode` function is not defined in the provided code.\n\n2. It initializes several variables:\n   - `chunks`: an array to store the chunks of code.\n   - `lineNumbers`: an array to store the line numbers where each chunk starts.\n   - `lines`: the input code split into lines.\n   - `currentChunk`: a string to hold the current chunk of code.\n   - `chunkStartLine`: an integer to track the line number where the current chunk starts.\n   - `nestingCount`: an integer to track the current nesting level.\n   - `inNest`: a boolean to indicate whether we are currently in a nested block of code.\n\n3. It then iterates over each line of code. For each line, it:\n   - Adds the line to the current chunk.\n   - Counts the number of left and right braces on the line.\n   - If there are left braces, it increases the nesting count by the number of left braces and sets `inNest` to `true`.\n   - If there are right braces, it decreases the nesting count by the number of right braces. If the nesting count becomes negative, it resets it to 0.\n   - If the nesting count is 0, the current chunk is not empty, and we are in a nested block, it adds the current chunk to the `chunks` array, adds the start line of the chunk to the `lineNumbers` array, resets the current chunk, and sets `inNest` to `false`.\n\n4. After iterating over all lines, if the current chunk is not empty, it adds it to the `chunks` array and adds the start line of the chunk to the `lineNumbers` array.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the `chunks` and `lineNumbers` arrays.\n\nThis function uses a simple algorithm to split code into chunks based on nesting level. It could be used, for example, to split a JavaScript function into its constituent blocks for further analysis.\n\nFor more information on JavaScript and its syntax, you can refer to this link: [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)"

The function is specifically looking for functions within the code and returns an array of these functions and their corresponding line numbers.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Input Parameters:** The function takes two parameters: `code` which is a string containing the source code to be parsed, and `functionName` which is the name of the function to be searched for in the code.\n\n2. **Variable Initialization:** The function initializes several variables to keep track of the functions found, their line numbers, the current function being parsed, the depth of nested braces, a flag to track whether we are currently inside a function, and the line number where the current function starts.\n\n3. **Parsing the Code:** The function splits the `code` string into an array of lines using the newline character `\\n` as the delimiter. It then loops over each line of code.\n\n4. **Identifying Functions:** If a line starts with the `functionName` and we're not currently inside a function, it starts a new function. All lines inside a function (including the function declaration line itself) are added to the `currentFunction` string.\n\n5. **Tracking Depth:** The function counts the number of opening `{` and closing `}` braces in each line to keep track of the depth of nested code blocks. When it encounters an opening brace, it increments the `depth` variable. When it encounters a closing brace, it decrements the `depth` variable.\n\n6. **End of Function:** If the `depth` variable becomes zero (indicating we're at the end of a function) and we're currently inside a function, it pushes the `currentFunction` and its start line number into their respective arrays. It then resets the `currentFunction` string, the `inFunction` flag, and the `startLineNumber` variable.\n\n7. **Final Check:** After the loop, if we're still inside a function, it pushes the remaining `currentFunction` and its start line number into their respective arrays.\n\n8. **Return Value:** The function returns a tuple containing the array of functions and their corresponding line numbers.\n\nThis function uses a simple parsing algorithm to analyze the code. It's a form of a state machine, where the state is determined by the `inFunction` flag and the `depth` variable.\n\nFor more information about parsing algorithms, you can refer to this link: [Parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing)"

This function is named `parsePerlFunctions` and it takes one argument, `code`, which is of type `string`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to parse Perl functions from a given string of Perl code. The function returns a tuple (an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element has its own type and the order of elements is significant) of two arrays: one array of strings (`functions`) and one array of numbers (`lineNumbers`).\n\nThe function `parsePerlFunctions` internally calls another function `parseBracketyLanguage` with two arguments: the `code` string and the string `\"sub\"`. The `parseBracketyLanguage` function is not defined in the provided code, but based on the context, we can infer that this is a generic function for parsing languages that use brackets (like Perl). The second argument `\"sub\"` likely tells `parseBracketyLanguage` to specifically look for Perl subroutine declarations, which start with the keyword `sub`.\n\nThe `parseBracketyLanguage` function is expected to return a tuple of two arrays: `functions` and `lineNumbers`. These are then returned by the `parsePerlFunctions` function.\n\nThe `functions` array likely contains the names of the Perl subroutines found in the `code` string, and the `lineNumbers` array likely contains the line numbers in the `code` string where these subroutines are declared.\n\nThe code does not appear to use any specific algorithm, but rather relies on the `parseBracketyLanguage` function to do the actual parsing work. The algorithm used by `parseBracketyLanguage` is not provided, but it would likely involve scanning the `code` string line by line, looking for lines that start with the `\"sub\"` keyword, and extracting the subroutine names and line numbers.\n\nThe code is consistent with the architectural guidelines provided. It is written in TypeScript, uses function programming style, and does not appear to have any conflicts with the guidelines.\n\nFor more education and background on TypeScript and Perl, you can refer to these resources:\n- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)\n- [Perl Programming Documentation](https://perldoc.perl.org/index-language.html)"

The function accepts a string of VB code as input and returns a tuple of two arrays: one for the functions/subroutines and one for the line numbers.\n\nThe function uses a simple algorithm to parse the code:\n\n1. It first checks whether a new parser (`useNewParser`) is being used. If so, it delegates the parsing to the `parseCode` function and returns its result.\n\n2. If the old parser is being used, the function splits the code into lines using the newline character (`\\n`).\n\n3. It initializes several variables to keep track of the current function being parsed (`currentFunction`), the depth of nested functions (`depth`), and the line number where the current function starts (`functionStartLine`).\n\n4. It then loops over each line of code. For each line, it checks if the line starts with the keyword \"Function\" or \"Sub\", indicating the start of a new function or subroutine. If it does, it increments the `depth` and checks if this is the first level of nesting (`depth === 1`). If so, it saves the current function and its starting line number to the `functions` and `lineNumbers` arrays, respectively, and starts a new `currentFunction` with the current line. Otherwise, it appends the current line to the `currentFunction`.\n\n5. If the line starts with \"End Function\" or \"End Sub\", indicating the end of a function or subroutine, it decreases the `depth`, appends the line to the `currentFunction`, and checks if this ends the outermost function (`depth === 0`). If so, it saves the current function and its starting line number to the `functions` and `lineNumbers` arrays, respectively, and resets the `currentFunction`.\n\n6. If the line does not start with any of these keywords, it simply appends the line to the `currentFunction`.\n\n7. After looping over all lines, if there is still a `currentFunction` left, it removes the last newline character and saves the function and its starting line number to the `functions` and `lineNumbers` arrays, respectively.\n\n8. Finally, it returns the `functions` and `lineNumbers` arrays as a tuple.\n\nThis function essentially implements a simple state machine for parsing VB code. The state transitions are based on the keywords \"Function\", \"Sub\", \"End Function\", and \"End Sub\". The state is represented by the `depth` and `currentFunction` variables.\n\nFor more information on VB programming, you can refer to the following link:\n- [Visual Basic Programming Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/)"

It returns two arrays: one with the methods found and another with the line numbers where these methods start.\n\nThe function starts by checking if a new parser should be used. If `useNewParser` is `true`, it calls the function `parseCode` with \"objective-c\" and the provided code as parameters, and returns the result.\n\nIf `useNewParser` is `false`, it proceeds with the old parsing method. It starts by splitting the code into lines. It initializes two empty arrays, `methods` and `lineNumbers`, and several other variables to keep track of the current method, the current depth of braces, whether it's inside an implementation block, and the line number where the current method starts.\n\nThen it loops over each line of the code. If a line starts with \"@implementation\", it's the start of an implementation block, so it sets `insideImplementation` to `true`. If a line starts with \"@end\", it's the end of an implementation block, so it sets `insideImplementation` to `false` and adds the current method and its start line to the respective arrays. If a line starts with \"-\", it's the start of a method, so if there's a current method, it adds it and its start line to the arrays.\n\nIf a line contains \"{\", it increases the depth of braces, and if it contains \"}\", it decreases the depth. This is used to keep track of the start and end of methods. If it's not inside an implementation block, it simply adds the line to the current method.\n\nFinally, if there's a current method after the loop, it adds it and its start line to the arrays, and returns the arrays.\n\nThis function uses a simple state machine algorithm to parse the code. State machine is a computational model used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits. It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states.\n\nHere's a link for more information about state machines: [State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)\n\nAnd here's a link for more information about Objective-C: [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C)"

The function uses a simple stack-based algorithm to track the depth of nested code blocks, and regular expressions to identify the start and end of blocks.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. If the `useNewParser` flag is true, it uses the `parseCode` function to parse the code and returns the result. This is a fallback mechanism that allows the use of a different parsing mechanism if available.\n\n2. The code string is split into an array of lines.\n\n3. Several variables are initialized: `blocks` and `lineNumbers` are empty arrays that will hold the output; `currentBlock` is an empty string that will hold the current block of code being parsed; `depth` is a counter for the current depth of nested blocks; `blockStartLine` is the line number where the current block starts.\n\n4. `blockStartKeywords` and `blockEndKeyword` are regular expressions that match the keywords that start and end blocks in Ruby, respectively.\n\n5. The function then loops over each line of code. If a line starts a new block, it increments `depth`. If `depth` is 1, it means we've started a new top-level block, so it pushes the current block and its start line number to the output arrays, and resets `currentBlock` and `blockStartLine`. If `depth` is greater than 1, it means we're inside a nested block, so it just appends the line to `currentBlock`.\n\n6. If a line ends a block, it decrements `depth`. If `depth` becomes 0, it means we've ended a top-level block, so it appends the line to `currentBlock`, pushes `currentBlock` and its start line number to the output arrays, and resets `currentBlock` and `blockStartLine`. If `depth` is still greater than 0, it means we're still inside a nested block, so it just appends the line to `currentBlock`.\n\n7. If a line doesn't start or end a block, it just appends it to `currentBlock`.\n\n8. After the loop, if there's still a `currentBlock`, it means the code ended in the middle of a block, so it pushes `currentBlock` and its start line number to the output arrays.\n\n9. Finally, it returns the `blocks` and `lineNumbers` arrays.\n\nThe algorithm used here is a simple depth-first search through the lines of code, using a stack (`depth`) to keep track of nested blocks.\n\nHere are some resources for further reading:\n- [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)\n- [Regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)\n- [Ruby syntax](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/doc/syntax_rdoc.html)"

The primary path through the code starts at the `parseRubyFunctions` function. The function first checks the `useNewParser` variable. If it is true, the code calls the `parseCode` function. If it is false, the code continues to the next block.\n\nThe code then splits the `code` string into lines and initializes some variables. It then iterates over each line and checks if it matches the `blockStartKeywords` regular expression. If it does, the code increments the `depth` variable and checks if the `depth` is equal to 1. If it is, the code adds the current block to the `blocks` array and adds the line number to the `lineNumbers` array. It then updates the `blockStartLine` variable and resets the `currentBlock` variable.\n\nIf the line matches the `blockEndKeyword` regular expression, the code decrements the `depth` variable and checks if the `depth` is equal to 0. If it is, the code adds the current block to the `blocks` array and adds the line number to the `lineNumbers` array. It then updates the `blockStartLine` variable and resets the `currentBlock` variable.\n\nIf the line does not match any of the above conditions, the code appends the line to the `currentBlock` variable.\n\nFinally, if there is a remaining `currentBlock`, the code adds it to the `blocks` array and adds the line number to the `lineNumbers` array.\n\nNote: The control flow graph does not show any external library or non-standard function calls."

This function is used to parse Python code and extract all the functions defined in the code. It takes a string of Python code as an input and returns two arrays: one containing the functions and the other containing the line numbers where each function starts. \n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `const useNewParserForPython = true;` This line declares a constant `useNewParserForPython` and assigns it a boolean value of `true`.\n\n2. `export function parsePythonFunctions(code: string): [string[], number[]] {...}` This line exports a function called `parsePythonFunctions` that takes a single argument `code` of type string and returns a tuple of two arrays, one of strings and one of numbers.\n\n3. `if (useNewParser || useNewParserForPython) {...}` This is a conditional statement that checks if either `useNewParser` or `useNewParserForPython` is `true`. If so, it calls the `parseCode` function with the arguments \"python\" and `code`, and returns the result. The `parseCode` function is not defined in the provided code, but it presumably parses the code using a different method.\n\n4. `const lines = code.split(\"\\n\");` This line splits the `code` string into an array of lines, using the newline character as the delimiter.\n\n5. `const functions: string[] = [];` and `const lineNumbers: number[] = [];` These lines initialize two empty arrays, `functions` and `lineNumbers`, to store the functions and their corresponding starting line numbers, respectively.\n\n6. `let currentFunction = \"\";` and `let functionStartLine = 0;` These lines initialize two variables, `currentFunction` and `functionStartLine`, to keep track of the function currently being parsed and its starting line number.\n\n7. The `for` loop iterates over each line in the `lines` array. If a line starts with \"def \" (indicating the start of a Python function), it pushes the `currentFunction` and its starting line number to the `functions` and `lineNumbers` arrays, respectively, and starts a new `currentFunction`. If a line does not start with \"def \", it is added to the `currentFunction`.\n\n8. After the `for` loop, if there is a `currentFunction`, it is pushed to the `functions` array and its starting line number is pushed to the `lineNumbers` array.\n\n9. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the `functions` and `lineNumbers` arrays.\n\nThe code follows standard best practices for TypeScript and does not appear to conflict with the provided architectural guidelines. It uses a simple algorithm to parse the Python code: it splits the code into lines and iterates over them, building up functions and recording their starting line numbers.\n\nFor more information about Python functions, you can refer to this link: [Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp). For more information about TypeScript, you can refer to this link: [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)."

An interface in TypeScript is a way of defining a contract for a certain structure of an object. It specifies a set of properties and methods that an object should have, but it doesn't provide any implementation details. Interfaces are used for type-checking in TypeScript.\n\nThe `LanguageConfig` interface has four properties:\n\n1. `startKeywords`: This property is an array of strings. It's used to specify the keywords that mark the start of a code block in a particular programming language. For example, in JavaScript, this could include keywords like 'function', 'if', 'for', etc.\n\n2. `endKeywords`: This property is also an array of strings. It's used to specify the keywords that mark the end of a code block in a particular programming language. For example, in JavaScript, this could include keywords like 'end', 'else', etc.\n\n3. `braceBased`: This is a boolean property. It's used to indicate whether the programming language uses braces `{}` to denote code blocks. For example, this would be `true` for languages like JavaScript and C++, and `false` for languages like Python.\n\n4. `indentationBased`: This is an optional boolean property. If present, it's used to indicate whether the programming language uses indentation to denote code blocks. For example, this would be `true` for Python and `false` for JavaScript.\n\nThis interface is likely used in a code analysis or syntax highlighting tool that needs to understand the structure of code blocks in different programming languages. The `startKeywords`, `endKeywords`, `braceBased`, and `indentationBased` properties provide a simple way to specify the rules for identifying code blocks in a language.\n\nFor more on TypeScript interfaces, you can visit this link: [TypeScript Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)"

This configuration is used to identify and handle blocks of code in each programming language. The configuration for each language includes:\n\n- `startKeywords`: An array of keywords that indicate the start of a block of code.\n- `endKeywords`: An array of keywords that indicate the end of a block of code.\n- `braceBased`: A boolean value indicating whether the language uses braces `{}` to delimit blocks of code.\n- `indentationBased`: A boolean value indicating whether the language uses indentation to delimit blocks of code. This property is only present in the Python configuration.\n\nHere's a brief description of each language configuration:\n\n- `javascript`: This configuration specifies that JavaScript is a brace-based language and does not use any specific start or end keywords to delimit blocks of code.\n- `vb`: This configuration specifies that Visual Basic (VB) is not a brace-based language and uses specific start (`Function`, `Sub`) and end (`End Function`, `End Sub`) keywords to delimit blocks of code.\n- `objc`: This configuration specifies that Objective-C is a brace-based language and uses specific start (`@implementation`, `-`) and end (`@end`) keywords to delimit blocks of code.\n- `ruby`: This configuration specifies that Ruby is not a brace-based language and uses specific start (e.g., `def`, `class`, `module`, etc.) and end (`end`) keywords to delimit blocks of code.\n- `python`: This configuration specifies that Python is an indentation-based language and is not a brace-based language. Python uses the start keyword `def` to delimit blocks of code and does not use any specific end keywords.\n\nThis configuration can be used in a text editor or IDE to correctly identify and handle blocks of code in each supported language. For example, it could be used to implement features like code folding, syntax highlighting, or automatic indentation.\n\nFor more information on how blocks of code are represented in different programming languages, you can refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Block (programming) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming))\n- [Indentation style - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style)\n- [Comparison of programming languages (syntax) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax))"

The function returns an array of chunks (a chunk is a piece of code that is logically grouped together) and their corresponding line numbers in the original code.\n\nThe function accepts three parameters:\n1. `language`: a string indicating the programming language of the code.\n2. `code`: a string of the code to be parsed.\n3. `functionName`: an optional string of a specific function name to be parsed.\n\nThe function uses a few variables to keep track of the parsing process, such as `chunks`, `lineNumbers`, `currentChunk`, `chunkStartLine`, `nestingCount`, `inNest`, `config`, and `currentIndentation`.\n\nThe function first splits the code into lines and then iterates over each line. Depending on whether the language uses indentation or braces to denote code blocks, it uses different logic to determine when a new chunk starts and ends.\n\nWhen the language uses indentation to denote code blocks, the function checks whether the line starts with a keyword that indicates the start of a block (e.g., `def` in Python). If it does and we are not currently in a nested block, we start a new block and increase the `nestingCount`. If the indentation of the line is less than or equal to the current indentation and we are in a nested block, we decrease the `nestingCount`.\n\nWhen the language uses braces to denote code blocks, the function counts the number of left and right braces in the line and adjusts the `nestingCount` accordingly. If the line contains a left brace and we are not currently in a nested block, we start a new block. \n\nIf the `nestingCount` becomes negative at any point, it is reset to 0. If the `nestingCount` is 0 and the current chunk is not empty, this means we have reached the end of a block. The function then adds the current chunk and its starting line number to their respective arrays, resets the current chunk, and updates the starting line number for the next chunk.\n\nFinally, after all lines have been processed, if there is still a chunk left, it is added to the `chunks` array.\n\nThe algorithm used here is essentially a type of parsing algorithm, specifically a context-free grammar parser. This type of parser is commonly used in compilers and interpreters to analyze source code.\n\nFor more information on parsing algorithms, you can refer to the following resources:\n- [Parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing)\n- [Context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar)"
