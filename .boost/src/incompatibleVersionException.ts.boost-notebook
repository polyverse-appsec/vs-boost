This class extends the built-in `Error` class, which means it inherits all the properties and methods of the `Error` class but can also have additional properties and methods.\n\nThe `IncompatibleVersionException` class has a constructor that can take up to three parameters: `message`, `expectedVersion`, and `actualVersion`.\n\n1. `message` (optional): This is a string that describes the error. It is passed to the `super` constructor which refers to the parent class constructor, in this case, the `Error` class. This is the standard way to pass a message when throwing an error.\n\n2. `expectedVersion` (optional): This is a string that specifies the expected version of something (possibly a software or a file). If no value is passed, an empty string is assigned as a default value.\n\n3. `actualVersion` (optional): This is a string that specifies the actual version of something. If no value is passed, an empty string is assigned as a default value.\n\nIn addition to the `message` property inherited from the `Error` class, this class also defines two additional properties: `expectedVersion` and `actualVersion`.\n\nThe `name` property is overridden with the string 'IncompatibleVersionException'. This is useful when logging errors, as it allows you to quickly identify the type of error.\n\nThis class can be used to throw an error when a version incompatibility is detected in your software. For example, you might have a function that checks the version of a file or a software, and if the actual version does not match the expected version, you can throw a new `IncompatibleVersionException`.\n\nFor more information on custom error classes in TypeScript, you can check the following link: [TypeScript - Custom Exceptions](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-custom-exceptions/)\n\nAs for the architectural guidelines, since there were no special constraints mentioned, this class seems to follow general good practices for defining custom exceptions in TypeScript. It's simple, clear, and extends the built-in `Error` class, which is the standard way to create custom error classes in JavaScript/TypeScript."
