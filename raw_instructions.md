# Polyverse Boost Visual Studio Extension
=======================================

**Transform, secure, and enhance your code with AI-driven analysis, all in one powerful extension - *Polyverse Boost*.**

Welcome to the Polyverse Boost Visual Studio extension! Boost is a powerful Visual Studio Code Notebook extension designed to help you modernize, enhance and sustain your software architecture and codebase - preserving the innovations you've invested in, and providing access to the latest technology (e.g. modern programming languages, Cloud services, containerization, microservice principles, and zero-trust code). Boost provides these services by analyzing your entire product codebase, including raw source code, comments and code documentation - and producing easily consumable Architectural Blueprints. Guided by your core Architecture, Boost will help you automatically convert your legacy code into a new programming language, analyze code for security vulnerabilities, find data and privacy compliance issues, ensure your source follows best practice coding guidelines, generate test cases for code using AI-driven tools. Operating on a stronger, more modern foundation - you can then add new features and solve your customer problems with confidence and faster innovation. Boost your Architecture and Productivity with Polyverse Boost and AI!

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Setup your Boost License** by contacting [Polyverse](https://polyverse.com/pages/boost-visual-studio) to get a free trial license key, or purchase a license key directly from the [Polyverse Store](https://polyverse.com/pages/boost-buy-visual-studio).

2. **Setup a [GitHub.com](https://GitHub.com) account** - to link your Polyverse license to your email address.
NOTE: Even if your GitHub email account is marked _Private_, you can still use it to link your license to your email address.
Polyverse Boost does not share your email with any 3rd party. Your email is only used to link your email to your billing account.

### Installation
1. **Install the Boost Modernization extension** from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Polyverse.polyverse-boost). NOTE: A restart of Visual Studio Code may be required.

2. **Authorize and Link Your GitHub.com account with Boost** The first time you launch Boost, you may need to Allow and Authorize Boost to access GitHub.com. This is only required to link your license to your email address. If you have not already done so, you will need to create a GitHub.com account.

7. **Run the AI-enabled Analysis and Processing**: For full file analysis across all Cells, click the Boost button `run-all`. Or select a single Boost Notebook cell and click the Boost button `run`.

    ![Analyze a single cell](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9940/8779/files/Screenshot_2023-03-28_at_1.45.43_PM.jpg?width=500)


8. **Review the Results**: Each Boost Notebook cell will contain the results of the AI-enhanced processing.
  * **For Architectural Blueprints**, you can analyze all aspects of your code and project to product a high-level Architectural Blueprint.
  * **For Defect and Security Analysis**, you can edit the code in each Cell and re-run the analysis to see the results.
  * **For Data Compliance**, you can review the data compliance issues in each Cell, and learn more about how your code uses data.
  * **For Coding Guidelines**, you can review the analysis in each Cell to see how your code follows best practices, or differs from standard coding guidelines.
  * **For Code Conversion**, you can review the new code in each Cell for integration into your new modernized project.
  * **For Documentation**, you can read the documentation to better understand legacy code, review for architectural or potential redesign, and to better understand how the original code actually worked.
  * **For Test Generation**, you can review the test cases and integrate them into your automated test harness or CI/CD/CT system.
