I apologize for the confusion earlier, as the code snippet I provided was a simplified version of the Heartbleed vulnerability. The actual vulnerable code is in the file "ssl/d1_both.c" in the OpenSSL library, specifically in the function "tls1_process_heartbeat()".

Here's the full function containing the Heartbleed bug:

c
Copy code
int tls1_process_heartbeat(SSL *s)
{
    unsigned char *p = &s->s3->rrec.data[0], *pl;
    unsigned short hbtype;
    unsigned int payload;
    unsigned int padding = 16; /* Use minimum padding */

    /* Read type and payload length first */
    hbtype = *p++;
    n2s(p, payload);
    pl = p;

    if (s->msg_callback)
        s->msg_callback(0, s->version, TLS1_RT_HEARTBEAT,
            &s->s3->rrec.data[0], s->s3->rrec.length,
            s, s->msg_callback_arg);

    if (hbtype == TLS1_HB_REQUEST)
    {
        unsigned char *buffer, *bp;
        int r;

        /* Allocate memory for the response, size is 1 byte
         * message type, plus 2 bytes payload length, plus
         * payload, plus padding
         */
        buffer = OPENSSL_malloc(1 + 2 + payload + padding);
        bp = buffer;

        /* Enter response type, length and copy payload */
        *bp++ = TLS1_HB_RESPONSE;
        s2n(payload, bp);
        memcpy(bp, pl, payload);
        bp += payload;

        /* Random padding */
        RAND_pseudo_bytes(bp, padding);

        r = dtls1_write_bytes(s, TLS1_RT_HEARTBEAT, buffer, 3 + payload + padding);

        if (r >= 0 && r < (3 + payload + padding))
            r = 0;
        else
            r = 1;

        OPENSSL_free(buffer);

        if (r == 0)
            return -1;

        if (s->tlsext_debug_cb)
            s->tlsext_debug_cb(s, 1, TLS1_RT_HEARTBEAT,
                buffer, 3 + payload + padding,
                s->tlsext_debug_arg);

        return 0;
    }

    /* If we receive a TLS1_HB_RESPONSE, we do not send back a response. */
    if (hbtype == TLS1_HB_RESPONSE)
    {
        if (s->tlsext_hb_pending)
        {
            /* We only want to process the first response that we receive. */
            s->tlsext_hb_pending = 0;
            s->tlsext_hb_seq++;
        }

        return 0;
    }

    return 1; /* Ignore the request if the heartbeat message is not well-formed. */
}
The bug is caused by the lack of validation of the payload variable before using it in the memcpy() function. The same fix as mentioned before applies here: you should add a check to ensure payload doesn't exceed the size of the received message before calling memcpy().

You can find the vulnerable source code in the OpenSSL repository on GitHub, specifically in the commit with hash 4817504d069b4c5082161b02a22116ad75f822b1. The link to the specific file is:
