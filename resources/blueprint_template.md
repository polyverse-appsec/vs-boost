## Architectural Blueprint Summary for: Name of Software
* Software Project Type: web app, server code, cloud web service, mobile app, shared library, etc.
* Software Principles: multi-threaded, event-driven, data transformation, server processing, client app code, etc
* Data Storage: shared memory, disk, database, SQL vs NoSQL, non-persisted, data separated from code
* Software Licensing: Commercial & Non-Commercial licenses, Open Source licenses (BSD, MIT, GPL, LGPL, Apache, etc.). Identify conflicting licenses.
* Security Handling: encrypted vs non-encrypted data, memory buffer management, shared memory protections, all input is untrusted or trusted
* Performance characteristics: multi-threaded, non-blocking code, extra optimized, background tasks, CPU bound processing, etc.
* Software resiliency patterns: fail fast, parameter validation, defensive code, error logging, etc.
* Analysis of the architectural soundness and best practices: code is consistent with its programming language style, structure is consistent with its application or server framework
* Architectural Problems Identified: coarse locks in multi-threaded, global and shared memory in library, UI in a non-interactive server, versioning fragility, etc.
* Short summary of the above that can be used as a reference for analyzing other code in this codebase
