# Boost In Action

To launch analysis on your project, use the Boost Activity Bar on the left to "Run Selected Analyses".

By default, you can run a sample of the top 5 AI-chosen files on any project, including security, data compliance, documentation, and bug analysis.

You can ask questions about your software project, architecture, and code by using the Sara chat window.

You can also select "Analyze All Files" to analyze all files in your project.

Sara, the Boost AI, will estimate your usage, costs, and update on your current account status.
