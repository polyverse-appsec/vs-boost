# Setting up Paid Account

**Paid Accounts**: Trial accounts can perform any action that a paid account can. The only difference is that trial accounts are limited to $100 worth of Sara and Boost usage.

Analysis operations and Sara requests are billed against any open Trial limit, or the associated paid account.
