## Troubleshooting

### FAQ: Common Questions and Issues

 * Q: What languages are supported for code conversion?
 * A: Most modern programming languages are supported, including: Python, Rust, Ruby, Golang, Swift, Visual Basic, Java, C\#, C++, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

 * Q: I don't have a [GitHub.com](https://GitHub.com) account. Can I still use the Boost extension?
 * A: You must your email address registered with a valid [GitHub.com](https://GitHub.com) account. You do not need to store any source code on GitHub.com, but you do need to have a valid verified email so we can confirm your license key at runtime.

 * Q: My source code is proprietary to me or my company, that I do not want to store on other servers. Can I still use the Boost extension?
 * A: Yes. The Boost extension does not require you to store any source code on GitHub.com. Also, Polyverse does NOT store or retain any of your source code during analysis. Your source code is only stored on your local system running Visual Studio Code.

 * Q: Will the converted code automatically build and run?
 * A: No. The converted code is provided as a starting point for you to review and integrate into your project. You will need to review the converted code, make any necessary changes to ensure it builds and runs correctly, and integrate it into your build or CI/CD system.

 * Q: The generated documentation is in Notebook cells. How do I export to a single file or PDF?
 * A: You can use the `File > Export As...` menu to export the Notebook as a single HTML file, or as a PDF.

 * Q: My source project is very large? How much source code can the Boost process?
 * A: The Boost extension can process large source code files. It is optimized specifically to break your source file
        into individual function Cells for analysis, review, and editing. This allows each function to be independently
        analyzed in real-time. As each Cell and function analysis is completed, you can review specific Cells.

 * Q: I ran analysis and processing on a source file, but some Cells did not complete processing. What's wrong?
 * A: A analysis timeout may have occurred for some functions or Cells. You can re-run the analysis on the Cells that did not complete processing, without re-running the full file analysis.

 * Q: I have another issue that was not addressed here. How can I get Support?
 * A: If you encounter any other issues or have questions, please refer to the [Polyverse Boost](https://polyverse.com/pages/boost-visual-studio) website for more information and support options.

*Happy coding!*
